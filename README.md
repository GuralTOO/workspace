Front-end for RapidReview - https://workspace.gn-works.com

RapidReview functions similar to Google Drive, but also allows users to ask NLP questions from their knowledge base. 
Users can create folders and upload files. In each folder, they can ask an LLM powered AI questions and answers will be pulled from their documents.
At the moment, the functionality is limited to text conversations.
Our team is actively working on also allowing users to interact with quantitative data extracted from their files.

If you are passionate about AI, would like to take part in this project, or just chat - please reach out at gn237@cornell.edu

Most of the back-end for this project in not publicly available, but some AI processing code is also on my github

Cheers!
